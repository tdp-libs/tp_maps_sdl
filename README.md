## Android Build Instructions
For Android you will need to build the SDL .aar and copy it into the project.
1. Build SDL 2 using these instructions: [android_libsdl2](https://github.com/tompaynter03/android_libsdl2).
2. Copy the ```android-sdl2``` directory generated by the previous step into the root of this 
project, eg: ```../android-sdl2```.
